TROUBLESHOOTING
If you run this script and get an error like "/usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory":
Find the python interpreter and set the first line in this file to reflect it's full path.
For example, if the python program is at /bin/python make the first line "#!/bin/python"

If you run this script get an error like "ImportError: No module named urllib":
Make certain that you have a full modern python (Python 2.5.1 at the time of writing) by running "python --version".
If you have a python older than 2.4, you will need to upgrade to a newer version.
